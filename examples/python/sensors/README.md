The _**Sensor**_ component represents some physical device which observes data.

The API can be used to get and set the configuration of a particular sensor. This could include, for example,
enabling raw data logging for a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL).

Sensors can also send and receive _**SensorsObservations**_ using the _**ObservationService**_.
