The _**Source**_ component represents some "aiding" or "input" source e.g. GNSS or Time.

The API can be used to get and set the configuration of a particular source. This could include, for example,
the source's lever arms; the lever arms relate the position of the source to the central reference point of the vessel.

Sources can also send and receive _**SourceObservations**_ using the _**ObservationService**_.
